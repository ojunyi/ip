Usage for tag A-BetterGui

Prompt - A-BetterGui
Change Gui to make it look friendlier.
Result
Adopted a blue background and removed the 'flip' style of texting that normal chats have. Chat resembles a 'blue' Discord-ish vibe. For some reason, it added ★ symbols everywhere which were illegal characters that could not be loaded.
Manual update
Removed all the stars. Change User to yellow and BuddiBoi green. Increase all font sizes. Removed maxWidth 500px from DialogBox so that text does not automatically wrap at 500px.

Prompt - A-BetterGui
Add a dynamic typing response for BuddiBoi to make it feel more interactive
Result
Updated MainWindow.java and MainWindow.fxml to include a small delay along with a dynamic "Typing" plus moving dots at the back to simulate typing. i.e. "Typing." -> "Typing.." -> "Typing..."
Manual update
Increase delay by 1 second

Promot - A-Personality
Could you help me change the text that BuddiBoi returns so that it sounds more like its name?
Result
Made BuddiBoi much more affirming using responses like 'Got it!' or "Understood'. Added supportive responses as well such as 'Keep it up!' or 'Wonderful!'.
Manual update
